# Induction Computing

[1. Induction Assignment](#Induction-Assignment)

## Learning outcomes

### This module aims to: 

*Provide an introduction to KOL and the University of Essex Online, its virtual learning environment (VLE), Moodle, and the available library resources.  Familiarise students with the resources available in the Study Skills Hub. Guide students on how to best engage in online learning (learning communities, organising learning).

*Introduce students to the ideas of reflective learning and critical thinking.

*Refresh students’ knowledge of referencing and the avoidance of academic dishonesty.

*Introduce the skills required for successful completion of future modules (including academic writing and research skills).

### In this module I shall:

*Demonstrate the technical and personal requirements of online learning.

*Demonstrate competencies in the use of the tools available to online learners.

*Demonstrate academic skills, e.g. essay/report writing, research techniques, referencing, reflective learning and critical thinking at a level commensurate with Postgraduate study.


### Induction Assignment

**Discuss the importance of a postgraduate degree in the Computer Science field.**

The education programme I am undertaking at the University of Essex Online is the MSc in Artificial Intelligence.  Even though I come from a non-STEM background, thanks to my professional experience, I came to realise how important ICT advancements are for most of the industries and the public sector, in general.   The Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at present continuously being tested and used in a variety of industries.  For example, Netflix produces hundreds of millions of film recommendations every day to subscribers, Amazon makes instant book/product suggestions depending on the search results and orders we have proceeded to.  Thanks to the strong computational power and the possibility to rapidly analyse datasets, AI is also helping to timely detect medical diseases and facilitate citizens to electronically submit documents in the public authorities by means of chatbots. 

Hern A. & Milmo D. (2024) argued that to make computers more intelligent, so they be able to resolve complicated problems, we must teach them learning patterns on how to imitate human behaviour.  Given that computers cannot independently think, they should be trained to analyse large amounts of data and then to make conclusions and inferences.  This is how AI is generally defined by academia and researchers.

I am currently working in the European Commission (EC), as a Stakeholder consultation expert and Horizontal coordinator of the Better Regulation agenda.  The reasons why I decided to dive into the world of Science and in particular in that of the AI are multiple.  AI will definitely shape the future of humanity and more concretely our life as consumers/citizens/voters/workers/patients or just humans.  

According to Deloitte (2018), ‘it is the merging of physical and digital realms, which not only creates interconnectedness, but also enables people to make more informed decisions’.  What will be the consequence of travelling on self-driving cars?  To what extent the life expectancy of an inhabitant on a small Aegean island will be determined by the trustworthy and reliable use of AI when detecting medical diseases?  How can AI help us interact with the public sector totally eclipsing the physical visit to public authorities?  What are the hidden concerns and risks of using uncontrolled AI-enabled tools?  How can we make sure that we address the potential mismanagement of the technology, and we mitigate the risks for the humanity? Who gets the ownership of a generative-AI product, whether it be an image, video or text, and disposes of their intellectual property and copyright: the ‘prompter’ or the AI system provider? What would be the implications for ordinary people if their personal data are leaked and processed without their consent? I am expecting that all these pertinent questions will undoubtedly be answered or at least touched upon during the educational programme.

The EU is one of the pioneers among the world regulators which has already introduced a framework as for the development of the AI.  According to its strategy, it is keen ‘[to] build institutional and operational capacity to ensure the development and use of trustworthy AI technologies’ (European Commission, 2024).  AI-enabled tools are currently being used, among others: i. to translate large documents into 24 official EU languages, ii. to summarise reports and studies, iii. to help civil servants deliver briefing notes to the policymakers, iv. to analyse thousands of contributions to a public consultation questionnaire, v. to analyse and draw conclusions from open text feedback comments to policy documents published on the Have Your Say web portal.  All these AI-enabled tools are being tested for their reliability and correctness, which sometimes is doubtful, therefore any AI-enabled product should be checked and approved by humans prior of its sharing. 

Given that AI use seems to be an irreversible trend which, will, beyond any doubt, influence our way of life and work, this educational programme will bring insights into these questions and make the students familiarise themselves with all the concepts, the ‘black box’, the interactions between patterns of datasets as well as with the risks.  While it may be doubtful whether AI will eliminate job positions, it is for sure legitimate to believe that a worker trained in AI will definitely replace another worker who refuses to learn about AI.

As for my personal expectations after completing the course, I would like to seek a job in the EC’s AI Office, which has already been created following the implementation of the AI act in 2024. That way I will be able not only to effectively monitor and oversee the implementation of the AI act but also to suggest practical solutions, recommendations and tools for the upcoming challenges from the wider use of AI, the ultimate objective being that EU delivers more evidence-informed legislative proposals and policies.
