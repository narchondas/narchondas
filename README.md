- 👋 Hi, I’m @narchondas
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in better regulation (evaluation, impact assessment and stakeholder consultation)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the advantages and pitfalls of the machine learning methods and algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI in the public sector and on code writing
- 📫 How to reach me: by email, via LinkedIn
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love swimming in the sea for more than an hour so, a couple of times, my friends were so worried that they wanted to call the coast guards as they assumed something bad had happened to me
  

# My Portfolio  
Welcome to my portfolio for the Module 3 Machine Learning! Here, you will find information about my studies, experience, and projects.  
# Machine-Learning
This is my learning experience for Module 3 of the MSc Artificial Intelligence

### In the module Machine Learning I shall:

*Learn about the key paradigms and algorithms in machine learning.

*Get an understanding of data analytics based on machine learning and using modern programming tools, such as Python or R.

*Experience how machine learning and data analytics can be used in real-world applications.

*Acquire the ability to gather and synthesise information from multiple sources to aid in the systematic analysis of complex problems using machine learning tools and algorithms.

### On completion of the module Machine Learning, I will be able to:

*Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.

*Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.

*Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.

*Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.
