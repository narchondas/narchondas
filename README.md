## MSc. Artificial Intelligence Cohort July 2024

## Professional
I am an expert in Better Regulation and in particular in Stakeholder Engagement. Since 2018, I have been working on European Commission's evaluations, impact assessments and stakeholder consultations. 

As Bellevue programme fellow in the SGMAP (2016-2017), I had the opportunity to work in the French public administration and deal with a different and challenging administrative and e-government context. 

As team leader and project manager, working in the Greek Ministry of Interior (2002-2016), I had the opportunity to lead several political and technical structural reform and e-government projects aiming at the modernisation of the Greek public administration. 

The administrative reform process is a magnificent ‚Äòjourney‚Äô full of excitement, setbacks but also of great achievements which better the lives of the European citizens.

This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth.**

**Initial Post**

The customer recommendation system by Amazon, the world-leader retail online store, makes extensive use of AI-enabled tools to improve customer experience and satisfaction with a view to ultimately increasing the orders placed by users and the business revenues.  Amazon recommendations are based on the products purchased by the user in the past on the same site, their visits to the Amazon product web pages as well as to those purchased by other customers with similar interests.    

The company even makes a step further by combining related products and offering a new more upgraded order option to the user.  The product combination is accompanied with a new price tag, so customers are indirectly pushed to buy both items based on data of preferences from customers with similar interests.  Amazon recommendation system has been made possible thanks to the possibility of analysing 'big data' real-time, originating from the order history and preferences of Amazon customers around the world.  According to S. Yin and O. Kaynak (2015), 'big data refers to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze', whereas the same authors argue that the customer-centric experience will primarily dominate the AI-enabled tools environment.

'The remarkable advances in computing power and the creation of the World Wide Web have facilitated the creation of very large data sets' (Russel, Stuart et al., 2021), which have subsequently contributed to the customisation of consumer order proposals.

To what extent do you believe that the protection of the personal data of customers is infringed when Amazon is collecting their preferences and making recommendations to them? To what extent do you believe that the use of AI-enabled tools for recommendations is nudging customers to buy more and more products from the same company, leading to disloyal competition practices?

**Summary**

The customer recommendation system by Amazon makes extensive use of AI-enabled tools to improve customer experience with a view to ultimately increasing orders placed by users and business revenues.  Amazon recommendations are based on the products purchased by the user in the past on the same site, their visits to the Amazon product web pages as well as to those purchased by other customers with similar interests.    

The company even makes a step further by offering a combination of products, accompanied with a new price tag, so customers are indirectly pushed to buy more items.  Amazon recommendation system has been made possible thanks to the possibility of analysing 'big data' real-time, originating from the order history and preferences of Amazon customers around the world.  This is line with what S. Yin and O. Kaynak (2015) have argued, namely that the customer-centric experience will primarily dominate the AI environment.

Peers reacting to the post have expressed their concern primarily when it comes to the question of clarity/transparency of how customer data are being used and also to the frustration that such recommendation system may generate if perceived by online customers as too intrusive and (Moore et al., 2015) ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô. 

It turns out that these companies have much more leverage than their customers concerning data collection and AI utilization.  This is why it is crucial that a legal/regulatory framework be adopted by governments. The EU AI Act (2024), one of the first attempts of a world regulator to put some boundaries and limits to the uncontrolled use of AI, seems to strike the right balance between innovation and safety/ethics. It allows researchers to experiment with AI tools in lab conditions, while at the same time prohibiting AI use representing an unacceptable risk.   It seems plausible that apart from the EU, other big regulators will follow suit and adopt similar measures, if they wish to continue trading with the EU Single market (the so called 'Brussels effect').

### Collaborative Discussion 1
**Imagine you have submitted a paper for publication (see Brown, 1994 in this week‚Äôs reading list). The editor has returned his comments saying that he is willing to accept the paper for publication on condition that Table 2 (see Brown, 1994) is changed. He feels that ‚Äòit is difficult for the reader to understand, contains too much information and is too large.‚Äô  You now have to redo the table 2 and present some of the findings using plots and present your results in the forum. Reflect also upon your experiences of undertaking this task and what you have learnt.**

**Initial Post**

Let me open this discussion forum with my experience when dealing with the activity of Unit 5 and in particular with the Table 2 of the article.  

Table 2 is quite informative as to the opinions of the general practitioners in Nottinghamshire on intrapartum care.  However, it is too cumbersome to read and not so easy to understand.  My approach would be quite different.  Let me describe to you how I reflected on this.  

Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion.  At first, I thought it would be a good idea to take those statements with a rate of approval above 50% to showcase the findings of the research.  However, the statements which had got above the threshold of 50% were 11, so it would not make much difference for the visualisation of the data.  

Then, I chose the statements which equal to or go above 75% of the approval.  I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart (please see below) as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a92d0780-6d7c-4852-bcde-b45de2d0f9d4)


In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' (please see below) to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d742e33a-0d40-4cc5-aef3-73009221e99e)


In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.

**Summary Post**

To provide a good visualisation of the Table 2, I took a different approach from the one taken by the authors of the article.  As Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion, I thought it would be a good idea to take only those statements with a rate of approval above 75% to better showcase the findings of the research.   

I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.

My peers with whom I had the opportunity to exchange some ideas tested different methods equally valid and effective.  In brief, Elias opted for using AI-enabled tools to make a very easy to read graph which was quite nice to see.  As for Jaco, I particularly liked the approach of keeping the 'No opinion' option in the graph as according to him, this piece of information is quite worth telling.  For example, if practitioners overwhelmingly decline to answer a question, then the researcher has to understand the reason behind this behaviour.  So, both methods developed by my two peers are worth keeping in mind.  

As for the inclusion or not of the ‚ÄòNo opinion‚Äô answers when calculating the percentages, some researchers opt for discarding them and choose to measure only the valid ones ‚ÄòAgree‚Äô and ‚ÄòDisagree‚Äô.  Nevertheless, there are some others who prefer to give a full account of the 'Agree', 'Disagree' and No opinion' answer options and they calculate the percentage of all these options.  In my opinion, both approaches can be used depending on the findings of the research and on whether we wish to give a detailed or less detailed account of the data we have collected.

To sum up, I opted for simplicity by highlighting only the most popular statements and by putting the whole table with all the details in an annex.  Another method was to provide very descriptive graph with vivid colours to highlight the differences of popularity among practitioners of the 24 statements.  Last but not least, it could be another option to focus on the 'Agree' rate and the rate of the 'No opinion' as this aspect could be very informative for our understanding of the research findings.  

In all the abovementioned cases, after the graphs are provided, it depends on the storyteller to frame the message they want to convey to the readers.  So, I think that the visualisation may at the end of the day help the storyteller develop a certain analysis and narrative for their research.

### Collaborative Discussion 2
**Discussion Topic 
When dealing with statistical data, particularly for decision-making purposes, misinterpretations can be a serious issue.  For this collaborative discussion, read the Greenland et al. (2016) article from this week‚Äôs reading and reflect on these questions:  Under what situations should confidence intervals not be reported?  Why is a p-value not always enough to report?**

A lower than 0.05 (5%) p-value, as we have learned in this Module, enables us to reject the null hypothesis and assume that the test hypothesis is valid.  Conversely, a p-value higher than 0.05 (5%) lead us to the conclusion that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and so the sample differences may be attributed to chance.   

In this regard, Ranstam (2012) argues that 'statistically insignificant outcome indicates nothing more than that the observed sample is too small to detect a population effect.  A statistically insignificant outcome should be interpreted as ‚Äúabsence of evidence, not evidence of absence‚Äù.  In other words, if a p-value is greater than the arbitrary cut-off of 5%, we lack evidence to assume that the test hypothesis is valid, but we cannot say with certainty that the null hypothesis is true.  According to Ranstam (2012), '[a] P-value provides only uncertainty information vis-a-vis a specific null hypothesis, no information on the statistical precision of an estimate.

'The smaller the P value, the more unusual the data would be if every single assumption were correct; but a very small P value does not tell us which assumption is incorrect'.  'Not only does a P value not tell us whether the hypothesis targeted for testing is true or not; it says nothing specifically related to that hypothesis unless we can be completely assured that every other assumption used for its computation is correct‚Äîan assurance that is lacking in far too many studies' (Greenland et al., 2016)

Sullivan & Feinn (2012) add another interesting dimension when dealing with and interpreting p-value and confidence intervals, that of the effect size.  'The effect size is the main finding of a quantitative study. While a P value can inform the reader whether an effect exists, the P value will not reveal the size of the effect.  In reporting and interpreting studies, both the substantive significance (effect size) and statistical significance (P value) are essential results to be reported. 

This means that it is not enough to only report the p-value as this could be misleading and not informative as for our research.

### End of Module 2 Assessment: Individual Reflection
**Assignment topic**

**This assessment focuses on your reflections on the skill and knowledge gained from the module. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through. Your reflection should address the following: Reflect in your data analysis skill and statistical knowledge and discuss how confident you are using R for statistical data analysis. Mention any challenges you faced.  Reflect upon your experience of interpreting statistical findings using p-value and confidence interval.  Also reflect upon on producing summary tables, contingency tables and producing plots using R.**

The Numerical Analysis module is part of the MSc programme, I am following at the University of Essex Online, in the field of Artificial Intelligence.   The aim of this module is for postgraduate students to: ‚Äòa) develop a systematic understanding of foundational mathematical principles and methods, b) facilitate their ability to interpret the results generated when using data science and AI tools, c) critically evaluate the use of statistical analysis and the numeric interpretation of results as aids in the decision-making process and d) critically appraise and present results of a statistical analysis to a diverse audience‚Äô (UoEO Module Home, n.d.).  A prominent role in achieving these objectives plays the familiarisation of the postgraduate student with the RStudio, which makes statistical data analysis and representation of analysis results (plots, graphs) of large datasets much easier and faster.

For this individual reflection, I will make use of mainly two reflective models: 
a) ‚ÄòWhat? So What? Now what?‚Äô (experience, implication of the situation and action plan) (Driscol, 1994 and Rolfe et al., 2001) and 
b) the Gibbs‚Äô reflective Cycle (description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, action plan) (UoEO Short Guide to Reflective Writing, n.d. and The University of Edinburgh Reflection Toolkit, n.d.).  

According to the structure of the module, mathematical concepts and foundations of statistical data analysis were first presented on the learning platform either via lecturecasts, unit notes, or reading lists.  Further, we were tasked to perform RStudio commands to get a certain given result (by following the recommended material instructions).  Then, we were supposed to perform several formative tasks and data activities, to familiarise ourselves with the software and learn how to formulate commands (coding process) and get data analysis results by ‚Äòtrial and error‚Äô.
Given that I do not come from a STEM background myself, having to deal with mathematical concepts and statistical foundations was quite overwhelming for me, not to say a daunting task.  However, I was aware that some basic concepts of statistical analysis would be very helpful for me to advance with the following modules in the Artificial Intelligence programme.  What I have learned in this module, I believe will largely help me interpret statistical analysis results (assessing the p-value, the Confidence Interval (CI), the correlation co-efficient etc), be critical about the robustness of the findings and evaluate the usefulness of the statistical results as aids to decision-making process.

I enjoyed the first introductory units of the module very much, where basic mathematical and statistical concepts were effectively explained such as mean/median, minimum/maximum/range, variance/standard deviation, the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics etc.  In this effort of mine, my principal ally was the unit notes, the recommended reading lists, the seminar sessions and the activities we were asked to perform later.  The pace of the learning was normal, at least in the first half of the module, but it acquired much greater difficulty towards the end.  

In the last units, it has to be borne in mind that the lecturecasts were very difficult to understand, as they were intended for a more expert audience or at least to those who were already knowledgeable.  This is why I got to watch them again and again and, in particular, after having read the recommended bibliography, watched YouTube videos and visited informative websites on statistics and RStudio (Annex).   I was quite determined to get a grasp of all items to be covered in the module, so I made use of every available reliable source apart from the module material (Annex).  I also exchanged a series of emails with my tutor who kindly gave me feedback on the commands I had performed on RStudio and some hints when I needed some extra help.  
Another formative activity that also contributed to my learning process was engaging in a discussion with my peers (Collaborative discussions 1 & 2). Even though, due to the non-mandatory nature of the activity, not all peers contributed to the discussion, I exchanged valuable opinions with those who participated.  Having to draft a post and respond to the comments of the peers, made me read other material than that offered in the module, from the University of Essex online library and the Google Scholar.  Writing a post in a collaborative discussion forum may be work-intensive, as each postgraduate student is keen to share an impactful contribution, which will generate interest (Annex).

Nevertheless, the trickiest part for my learning process was performing commands and getting statistical results on RStudio.  This seemed to me quite frustrating at some point, as the absence of a bracket ‚Äò()‚Äô or the superfluous addition of a character made the software giving an ‚Äòerror‚Äô.  In many cases, it was not clear to me where the error was lying.  This is why I had to repeat many times the commands, making sure that all components were included, ask guidance from my tutor, and seek help from reliable YouTube videos and websites.  After having completed the module, I now feel much more confident with at least the basic commands of the software such as performing basic arithmetic, converting variables, and managing missing variables, developing graphs and plots, creating sub samples, performing statistical analysis using a null or alternative hypothesis, taking a decision based on p-value and statistical significance and running normality tests, correlations tests, and regression analysis.

Familiarising myself with RStudio and statistical analysis made me realise how important it is to be able to understand if the result I get is statistically significant, if I can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative one (when the p-value is lower than 0.05), how to interpret the Confidence Interval etc  This will help me get an insight into whether the statistical analysis I read is reliable or not, so I can make an evidence-informed decision.  I am sure that the valuable knowledge gained in this module will help me understand better how the Artificial Intelligence is working as well as its potential and opportunities but also its risks and implications in our lives.

To conclude, I got to understand how important it is to learn by experience and by ‚Äòtrial and error‚Äô, especially when having to learn mathematical and statistical analysis concepts and perform RStudio commands.  While the feeling of frustration when you do not get the desired result or when you find it difficult to grasp a certain concept is overwhelming, on the other hand, it is equally rewarding when you are patient, read very carefully the material, ask the tutor for guidance, follow the seminar sessions, watch YouTube videos, seek other reliable sources and finally when you deepen your knowledge and reach the desired objective.

### Collaborative Discussion 1

### Instructions
**Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.  Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.**

‚ÄòSystem failure is a system that fails to develop or does so in a stunted fashion‚Äô (Carlsson and Jacobsson ,1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).   The first six months of 2018, the national IT systems across the NHS in Wales experienced such system failures as a total of 21 outages took place resulting in various disruptions for GPs, health care staff and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).   

These IT system failures in the Welsh NHS affected appointments, prescriptions and in general the health care provision as the professionals were unable to access electronic patients records for several hours (Donnely, 2018).   Moreover, patients could not book or re-book or cancel their appointments, nor be given test results, whereas GPs could not have access to blood and X-Ray results (BBC, 2018).  Dr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: "Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients‚Äô (Geraint, 2018).

As Schwab (2016) pointed out the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we are now experiencing, is a distinct one compared to the previous as for three components: velocity, scope, and systems impact.  System interdependencies can result in disrupting daily life and industries in every country.  On top of that, there may be a widespread feeling among the population that the extensive availability and circulation of high volumes of both structured and unstructured data has a negative impact on our inner lives and therefore we may lose control over them.
By interdependency is meant ‚Äòa bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other‚Äô.  This is why, ‚Äò[‚Ä¶] identifying, understanding, and analysing such interdependencies are significant challenges‚Äô, exacerbated by the breadth and complexity of critical IT nationwide infrastructures (Rinaldi et al., 2001).

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

Realising to what extent governments and public or private databases are vulnerable to failures or to external threats is crucial for how public policies will take shape and public goods will be delivered to citizens in the future.  Concerns about the vulnerability may even make countries roll back their initial plans for full replacement of the physical dimension into the digital one.  ‚ÄòSweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them.  Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as the only alternative that is easily available‚Äô (Bryant, 2024).
