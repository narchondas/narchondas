## MSc. Artificial Intelligence Cohort July 2024

## Professional
I am an expert in Better Regulation and in particular in Stakeholder Engagement. Since 2018, I have been working on European Commission's evaluations, impact assessments and stakeholder consultations. 

As Bellevue programme fellow in the SGMAP (2016-2017), I had the opportunity to work in the French public administration and deal with a different and challenging administrative and e-government context. 

As team leader and project manager, working in the Greek Ministry of Interior (2002-2016), I had the opportunity to lead several political and technical structural reform and e-government projects aiming at the modernisation of the Greek public administration. 

The administrative reform process is a magnificent ‚Äòjourney‚Äô full of excitement, setbacks but also of great achievements which better the lives of the European citizens.

### Collaborative Discussion 1
**Imagine you have submitted a paper for publication (see Brown, 1994 in this week‚Äôs reading list). The editor has returned his comments saying that he is willing to accept the paper for publication on condition that Table 2 (see Brown, 1994) is changed. He feels that ‚Äòit is difficult for the reader to understand, contains too much information and is too large.‚Äô  You now have to redo the table 2 and present some of the findings using plots and present your results in the forum. Reflect also upon your experiences of undertaking this task and what you have learnt.**

**Initial Post**

Let me open this discussion forum with my experience when dealing with the activity of Unit 5 and in particular with the Table 2 of the article.  

Table 2 is quite informative as to the opinions of the general practitioners in Nottinghamshire on intrapartum care.  However, it is too cumbersome to read and not so easy to understand.  My approach would be quite different.  Let me describe to you how I reflected on this.  

Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion.  At first, I thought it would be a good idea to take those statements with a rate of approval above 50% to showcase the findings of the research.  However, the statements which had got above the threshold of 50% were 11, so it would not make much difference for the visualisation of the data.  

Then, I chose the statements which equal to or go above 75% of the approval.  I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart (please see below) as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' (please see below) to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d742e33a-0d40-4cc5-aef3-73009221e99e)


In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.

**Summary Post**

To provide a good visualisation of the Table 2, I took a different approach from the one taken by the authors of the article.  As Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion, I thought it would be a good idea to take only those statements with a rate of approval above 75% to better showcase the findings of the research.   

I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.

My peers with whom I had the opportunity to exchange some ideas tested different methods equally valid and effective.  In brief, Elias opted for using AI-enabled tools to make a very easy to read graph which was quite nice to see.  As for Jaco, I particularly liked the approach of keeping the 'No opinion' option in the graph as according to him, this piece of information is quite worth telling.  For example, if practitioners overwhelmingly decline to answer a question, then the researcher has to understand the reason behind this behaviour.  So, both methods developed by my two peers are worth keeping in mind.  

As for the inclusion or not of the ‚ÄòNo opinion‚Äô answers when calculating the percentages, some researchers opt for discarding them and choose to measure only the valid ones ‚ÄòAgree‚Äô and ‚ÄòDisagree‚Äô.  Nevertheless, there are some others who prefer to give a full account of the 'Agree', 'Disagree' and No opinion' answer options and they calculate the percentage of all these options.  In my opinion, both approaches can be used depending on the findings of the research and on whether we wish to give a detailed or less detailed account of the data we have collected.

To sum up, I opted for simplicity by highlighting only the most popular statements and by putting the whole table with all the details in an annex.  Another method was to provide very descriptive graph with vivid colours to highlight the differences of popularity among practitioners of the 24 statements.  Last but not least, it could be another option to focus on the 'Agree' rate and the rate of the 'No opinion' as this aspect could be very informative for our understanding of the research findings.  

In all the abovementioned cases, after the graphs are provided, it depends on the storyteller to frame the message they want to convey to the readers.  So, I think that the visualisation may at the end of the day help the storyteller develop a certain analysis and narrative for their research.

### Collaborative Discussion 1

### Instructions
**Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.  Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.**

‚ÄòSystem failure is a system that fails to develop or does so in a stunted fashion‚Äô (Carlsson and Jacobsson ,1997 in Bergek et al., 2008).   The first six months of 2018, the national IT systems across the NHS in Wales experienced such system failures as a total of 21 outages took place resulting in various disruptions for GPs, health care staff and patients (Postelnicu, 2018).   

These IT system failures in the Welsh NHS affected appointments, prescriptions and in general the health care provision as the professionals were unable to access electronic patients records for several hours (Donnely, 2018).   Moreover, patients could not book or re-book or cancel their appointments, nor be given test results, whereas GPs could not have access to blood and X-Ray results (BBC, 2018).  Dr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: "Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients‚Äô (Geraint, 2018).

As Schwab (2016) pointed out the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we are now experiencing, is a distinct one compared to the previous as for three components: velocity, scope, and systems impact.  System interdependencies can result in disrupting daily life and industries in every country.  On top of that, there may be a widespread feeling among the population that the extensive availability and circulation of high volumes of both structured and unstructured data has a negative impact on our inner lives and therefore we may lose control over them.
By interdependency is meant ‚Äòa bidirectional relationship between two infrastructures through which the state of each infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other‚Äô.  This is why, ‚Äò[‚Ä¶] identifying, understanding, and analysing such interdependencies are significant challenges‚Äô, exacerbated by the breadth and complexity of critical IT nationwide infrastructures (Rinaldi et al., 2001).

The Welsh NHS IT system failures had to do with infrastructures which share cyber interdependency (Rinaldi et al., 2001), meaning that their state depends on information transmitted through the information infrastructure.  Eventually, such weaknesses in system structure may lead to interaction failures (related to networks) and to institutional failures (related to institutions) as it was the case of the Welsh NHS outages and may have an impact on the public trust towards state actors and operators.

Realising to what extent governments and public or private databases are vulnerable to failures or to external threats is crucial for how public policies will take shape and public goods will be delivered to citizens in the future.  Concerns about the vulnerability may even make countries roll back their initial plans for full replacement of the physical dimension into the digital one.  ‚ÄòSweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them.  Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as the only alternative that is easily available‚Äô (Bryant, 2024).
