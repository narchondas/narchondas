## Collaborative Discussion 1

### Initial & summary posts

**Imagine you have submitted a paper for publication (see Brown, 1994 in this week’s reading list). The editor has returned his comments saying that he is willing to accept the paper for publication on condition that Table 2 (see Brown, 1994) is changed. He feels that ‘it is difficult for the reader to understand, contains too much information and is too large.’  You now have to redo the table 2 and present some of the findings using plots and present your results in the forum. Reflect also upon your experiences of undertaking this task and what you have learnt.**

**Initial Post**

Let me open this discussion forum with my experience when dealing with the activity of Unit 5 and in particular with the Table 2 of the article.  

Table 2 is quite informative as to the opinions of the general practitioners in Nottinghamshire on intrapartum care.  However, it is too cumbersome to read and not so easy to understand.  My approach would be quite different.  Let me describe to you how I reflected on this.  

Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion.  At first, I thought it would be a good idea to take those statements with a rate of approval above 50% to showcase the findings of the research.  However, the statements which had got above the threshold of 50% were 11, so it would not make much difference for the visualisation of the data.  

Then, I chose the statements which equal to or go above 75% of the approval.  I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart (please see below) as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a92d0780-6d7c-4852-bcde-b45de2d0f9d4)


In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' (please see below) to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d742e33a-0d40-4cc5-aef3-73009221e99e)


In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.


**Summary Post**

To provide a good visualisation of the Table 2, I took a different approach from the one taken by the authors of the article.  As Table 2 refers to 24 statements to which general practitioners have expressed their agreement/disagreement/no opinion, I thought it would be a good idea to take only those statements with a rate of approval above 75% to better showcase the findings of the research.   

I found that 5 statements had got this percentage.   To illustrate the 5 most common opinions, I chose the horizontal bar chart as I think it better highlights the message of the research.  Nevertheless, for the sake of the research I would put the existing Table 2 in the annex, so a more interested reader might be able to find more information.

In addition, I would also choose a couple of statements which did not get the threshold of 75% but they are quite popular among practitioners and would try to make my point by illustrating the whole spectrum of responses (Agree/Disagree/No opinion).  For example, I would take the statement on the fear of litigation and make a 'doughnut' to highlight that only 20% of the practitioners seemed not to be afraid of litigation.  

In brief, to better highlight my arguments, I would choose the most popular statements and create a graph (preferably a bar chart or a pie chart).  I think that for the abovementioned case boxplots, scatter plots, line graphs etc would not be suitable.  

I would also choose a couple of interesting statements that I would like to refer to in my analysis and try to present the percentages of Agree/Disagree/No opinion, using a pie chart/doughnut.  I would go for the simplicity as the simplest plots/graphs seem to be effective in conveying the message and are easy-to understand for the reader.

My peers with whom I had the opportunity to exchange some ideas tested different methods equally valid and effective.  In brief, Elias opted for using AI-enabled tools to make a very easy to read graph which was quite nice to see.  As for Jaco, I particularly liked the approach of keeping the 'No opinion' option in the graph as according to him, this piece of information is quite worth telling.  For example, if practitioners overwhelmingly decline to answer a question, then the researcher has to understand the reason behind this behaviour.  So, both methods developed by my two peers are worth keeping in mind.  

As for the inclusion or not of the ‘No opinion’ answers when calculating the percentages, some researchers opt for discarding them and choose to measure only the valid ones ‘Agree’ and ‘Disagree’.  Nevertheless, there are some others who prefer to give a full account of the 'Agree', 'Disagree' and No opinion' answer options and they calculate the percentage of all these options.  In my opinion, both approaches can be used depending on the findings of the research and on whether we wish to give a detailed or less detailed account of the data we have collected.

To sum up, I opted for simplicity by highlighting only the most popular statements and by putting the whole table with all the details in an annex.  Another method was to provide very descriptive graph with vivid colours to highlight the differences of popularity among practitioners of the 24 statements.  Last but not least, it could be another option to focus on the 'Agree' rate and the rate of the 'No opinion' as this aspect could be very informative for our understanding of the research findings.  

In all the abovementioned cases, after the graphs are provided, it depends on the storyteller to frame the message they want to convey to the readers.  So, I think that the visualisation may at the end of the day help the storyteller develop a certain analysis and narrative for their research.


### Response to my peers' posts


Hello Elias,

it's been quite a while since the last time we spoke to each other via the discussion forum.  I was quite impressed with what you did considering the complexity of the dataset (a lot of statements, percentages etc).  

As you say, putting everything in one table/spreadsheet is not ideal from a visualisation point of view.  Nevertheless, I strongly believe that such information should be part of the research paper as it provides a detailed information on the opinions of the consulted individuals.

Taking advantage of the AI capabilities as for the visualisation of the data seemed to me quite smart from your side.  Why should we not try prompting the AI tool (ChatGPT) when we wish to create effective and though-provoking graphs for our research purposes? 

As you may have noticed, I opted for a different way of highlighting interesting research data.  In my case, I chose the most popular statements and produced plots/bars/doughnut using Excel.  At the end of the day, when you read a paper you will not understand the rationale of the research unless you visualise the most significant arguments/points.  So I chose the most popular statements and made some graphs.  

Having said the above, for the sake of the objectivity of the research, I would put the whole table with the data as an Annex to the paper, so the reader who would be more interested to look at the details should be able to do so.


Dear Jaco,

I very much liked your approach in depicting the research data.  First, you tried to summarise the statements, so they become more reader friendly.   Then, I particularly liked your reasoning as for the inclusion in your graph of the answer options 'Agree' and 'No opinion'.  

In fact, I have been thinking quite a while about how to treat the component 'No opinion', as it may give us valuable information.  For example, if 40% of the respondents declined to give a straightforward answer, then it might be a proof that something was wrong with the question itself or with the issue it raised.  However, it is equally intriguing how you deal with the 'No opinion' component when calculating the percentages.  Do you take it into account or not?

Some researchers opt for discarding 'No opinion' answers and calculate only the valid ones.  Nevertheless, there are some others who prefer to give a full account of the 'Agree', 'Disagree' and No opinion' answer options.  

In my opinion, both approaches can be used depending on the findings of the research and whether we wish to give a detailed or less detailed account of the data we have collected.

## Collaborative Discussion 2

**Discussion Topic**

**When dealing with statistical data, particularly for decision-making purposes, misinterpretations can be a serious issue.  For this collaborative discussion, read the Greenland et al. (2016) article from this week’s reading and reflect on these questions:  Under what situations should confidence intervals not be reported?  Why is a p-value not always enough to report?**

A lower than 0.05 (5%) p-value, as we have learned in this Module, enables us to reject the null hypothesis and assume that the test hypothesis is valid.  Conversely, a p-value higher than 0.05 (5%) lead us to the conclusion that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and so the sample differences may be attributed to chance.   

In this regard, Ranstam (2012) argues that 'statistically insignificant outcome indicates nothing more than that the observed sample is too small to detect a population effect.  A statistically insignificant outcome should be interpreted as “absence of evidence, not evidence of absence”.  In other words, if a p-value is greater than the arbitrary cut-off of 5%, we lack evidence to assume that the test hypothesis is valid, but we cannot say with certainty that the null hypothesis is true.  According to Ranstam (2012), '[a] P-value provides only uncertainty information vis-a-vis a specific null hypothesis, no information on the statistical precision of an estimate.

'The smaller the P value, the more unusual the data would be if every single assumption were correct; but a very small P value does not tell us which assumption is incorrect'.  'Not only does a P value not tell us whether the hypothesis targeted for testing is true or not; it says nothing specifically related to that hypothesis unless we can be completely assured that every other assumption used for its computation is correct—an assurance that is lacking in far too many studies' (Greenland et al., 2016)

Sullivan & Feinn (2012) add another interesting dimension when dealing with and interpreting p-value and confidence intervals, that of the effect size.  'The effect size is the main finding of a quantitative study. While a P value can inform the reader whether an effect exists, the P value will not reveal the size of the effect.  In reporting and interpreting studies, both the substantive significance (effect size) and statistical significance (P value) are essential results to be reported. 

This means that it is not enough to only report the p-value as this could be misleading and not informative as for our research.

Transcript

00:00:01

Hello my name

00:00:02

Is Nikos and I'm studying the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:09

This is the presentation of the Statistical analysis

00:00:14

That I performed based on the Health Survey for England data set for 2011, and this is the assignment of module 2.

00:00:29

So we were tasked by the University of Essex Online to produce some R studio.

00:00:37

Commands and produce the results of the survey using the data set on the Health Survey for England in 2011.

00:00:50

This health survey is designed to monitor trends in the nation’s health, and it provides some information that cannot be obtained from other sources on a range of issues, for instance.

00:01:05

How depressed English people feel, what is the status of the mental health?

00:01:13

Of them and what types of counseling they have used, if they drink alcohol, if they smoke, etc.

00:01:23

And this data set consists of a lot of variables in total 58.

00:01:31

I performed several Rstudio commands.

00:01:35

Let's say I tried to see the numbers of rows, the tables to find out the numbers in the categories in each variable.

00:01:47

I perform Chi-square test.

00:01:49

Non parametric tests as well and some also correlation tests as well.

00:01:58

It was really easy to perform.

00:02:02

These tasks with Rstudio and it can really process very very fast.

00:02:09

These analysis.

00:02:12

In particular, when you have to deal with such a big data set.  On the other hand, it is a little bit of a challenge because if you forget to put.

00:02:26

A bracket or to do a typo.

00:02:33

This does not work.  So let's go back to our presentation.

00:02:39

The first question was about.

00:02:42

The total respondents, which are included in the sample.

00:02:47

I produced some Rstudio commands and find out the number of rows

00:02:54

We can say that the respondents of the sample are 10617 people.

00:03:02

The second question was about the percentage of the people who drink alcohol and in that analysis I excluded the non-valid answers.

00:03:15

So I performed this analysis based on the Yes and No answers and I found out that approximately 79% of the people drink alcohol and approximately 21% claim.

00:03:31

Not to do so.

00:03:36

The other question was about the percentage of women in the sample and the numbers.

00:03:42

Are the following so.

00:03:45

5765 women have participated in the survey.

00:03:53

Representing more or less 56% of the total respondents.  When it comes to the highest educational level that I found was the NVQ 4 NVQ 5 slash degree or equivalent.
I kind of performed a Rstudio command to see the table and the categories of this variable.

00:04:29

Let's go to the descriptive statistics and.

00:04:35

To see how many divorced and separated people have participated in the sample.

00:04:42

To be able to see this kind of figure.

00:04:46

I performed some Rstudio commands and found out the table.

00:04:51

And all the numbers of the categories of the marital status variable.

00:04:56

And also you can notice that category four and five represent the separated and divorced people.

00:05:03

So in total you have 224 separated people and 594.

00:05:10

Divorced people participating in the sample, representing 9 and half percent of the total sum excluding the non-valid answers.

00:05:25

Here I was tasked to find the mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum range, and standard deviation of three variables.

00:05:35

In particular, that of the household size, the body mass index and the age of last birthday.

00:05:43

I'm not going to describe in every detail all the numbers but let me focus on one variable.

00:05:49

Let's go to the household size and.

There the median number is 3, so I assume that.

00:05:58

You have two parents and one child.

00:06:01

Minimum is one people, so you have just one people participate in the household and maximum 10 people. The range is 9 and the standard deviation is 1.37.

00:06:15

And let's go also to the age where the range is much greater because you have.

00:06:24

Babies also.

00:06:26

Taken into account in a survey.  You have minimum, zero and maximum 100. So the range is 100 and the standard deviation is much larger 23.83.

00:06:43

Here we were asked to run a significant test to find out.

00:06:50

Which gender drinks more alcohol?

00:06:54

So basically 84%.

00:06:59

Of men claim to drink alcohol and 74% of women claim to do so.

00:07:08

Here I performed the Chi-square test.

00:07:16

And so that the result of the test was 114.15 and the P value.

Is close to 0, far smaller than the 0.05 So we can reassume that the test is statistically significant.

00:07:37

There is a statistically significant association between.

00:07:41

Gender and drinking alcohol so we can assume that the distribution of alcohol consumption is not the same.
The null hypothesis is men and women have the same levels of alcohol consumption 
So we can reasonably assume that men and women do not have the same alcohol consumption levels and their consumption differs.

00:08:15

When it comes to the region, the English region which drinks the most alcohol there, I performed again a Chi-square test.

00:08:25

And the result was 98.53 and the P value is much much less than 5% so.

00:08:37

This indicates.

00:08:38

That there is a statistically significant difference in alcohol consumption across regions in England and of course this is corroborated by the small value.

We can reject the null hypothesis according to which all English regions have the same level of alcohol consumption.
We can really assume that the regions of England have different levels of alcohol consumption and to be more precise.

00:09:09

Region 9 South West.

00:09:12

Stands out as a region with significantly higher alcohol consumption than several other regions, approximately 84%.

00:09:26

Here.

00:09:29

I investigate whether there is a statistical difference between any women on the following variable.

00:09:36

So.

00:09:38

As for the height before.

00:09:41

Engaging in our command in our commands, I tried to find out whether the data on height is normally distributed.

00:09:54

And I perform the Anderson Darling normality test and the value was approximately 400 and the P value close to 0.

00:10:03

The data on the height significantly deviates from a normal distribution.

00:10:10

So this is why I performed the non-parametric test.

00:10:14

Wilcoxon ran-sum test (the Mann Whitney U test).

00:10:20

The statistical difference for this variable and the result I got, for instance an extremely small P value indicates that the difference in height between the two genders is statistically significant. So we can reject.

00:10:39

The null hypothesis that men and women.

00:10:42

Have the same kind of height and we can really assume that they have different height.

00:10:52

So men tend to be taller than women on average, as you can see.

00:11:01

I had to perform the same kind of statistical analysis as for another variable, the weight.

So again, I performed the Anderson Darling normally test to check whether the data on weight is normally distributed and it was not the case.

00:11:22

So I performed again the non-parametric test.

00:11:29

The Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (Mann Whitney U test).

00:11:33

And the values I got indicated that there is indeed a difference in weight between the two genders, which is statistically significant.

00:11:42

So in that sense, the p-value is close to 0, much less than 5%.

00:11:48

So we can reasonably reject the null hypothesis according to which men and women have the same weight.

We can reasonably assume that genders do not have the same weight.

00:12:03

So basically as you can see, men tend to be heavier than women on average.

00:12:12

On that slide, you can see the result of the correlation exercise.

00:12:19

Among four variables the drink nowadays.

00:12:23

Total household income.

00:12:25

Age at last birthday and gender. I'm not going to get into the details because you can read.

00:12:34

The results. But basically we had to produce the r (the correlation coefficient).

00:12:42

To see whether there would be a positive or negative correlation between.

00:12:48

Two variables.

00:12:52

And let me give you an example.

00:12:55

Let's take the drink nowadays and the total household income variables correlation exercise and we found.

00:13:05

That the r (the correlation coefficient) which indicates the strength and the direction of the correlation is close to 0.

00:13:15

It might be a little bit positive correlation, but it's close to 0 and the P-value also.

00:13:22

Is close to 0, so it is statistically significant.

00:13:29

Let's focus on the total household income and the gender, and there you can see a really very low close to 0 r and the p-value 0.6297, indicating that this kind of analysis is not statistically significant.

00:14:01

In conclusion, the P value was used to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two variables.

00:14:11

Very small p-value indicates that the correlation is statistically significant.

00:14:20

The majority of the relationships seem to be statistically significant but extremely weak, meaning that.

00:14:28

While there is kind of a very, very weak, extremely weak positive correlation between some variables.

00:14:36

We can assume that other variables may play a more significant role.
Let's then focus on some findings and compare the findings with some relevant literature on gender and alcohol correlation in the UK.
At more or less the findings of the survey corroborate what I have read in literature.

00:15:04

And 84% of men treat alcohol, compared to 74%

00:15:11

Of women who claim to do so.

00:15:15

The means that the general gap in alcohol consumption is narrowing over the last years.  In the past at least, men were considered to drink much more alcohol and much more often.

00:15:31

And this kind of rise in alcohol conception in women can be attributed to targeting advertising for a female public, to the pricing and to the changing socio-economic patterns of women.

00:15:47

And these factors may have impacted the rise in alcohol consumption among them.

00:15:56

However, men prefer drinking different kinds of alcohol, beers and spirits in public spaces, and women tend to drink more wine in non-public spaces, let's say at home.
Men are more likely to engage in binge drinking than women. Also, is another.

00:16:19

Point that I would like to stress.

00:16:25

Unfortunately, women tend to suffer more alcohol related health issues due to their body composition than men because women have a higher fat content and less water content.

00:16:44

So this is has a negative impact on their health.

00:16:50

Also, another point I would like to highlight is that the research has shown.

00:16:56

That the lowest socio-economic status is often associated with higher rates of alcohol consumption, particularly among men, and another interesting.

00:17:08

Piece of information is that.

00:17:11

People living in urban areas generally drink more alcohol than those living in rural areas.

00:17:22

So let me conclude and let me give you some recommendations on how to deal.

00:17:30

The alcohol consumption problem we could also.

00:17:35

Consider some targeted campaigns of awareness raising for health risks associated with high alcohol consumption.

00:17:44

According to the literature, a high a high price does have an impact on alcohol consumption.

00:17:51

Maybe we could also envisage this kind of policy.

00:17:57

We could also try some very extensive information campaigns making use of widely known role models which will try to disassociate alcohol consumption with influential and privileged social status.

00:18:18

A similar campaign to that on anti-tobacco can be very effective.

00:18:23

So let me remind you that you have some product labeling rules, and you have the obligation.

00:18:31

To include some health warnings on the package of the cigarettes and you have a advertising prohibition.

00:18:42

The result was that the share of smokers, at least in wealthier countries, tend to continuously diminish.

00:18:48

So we could also consider this kind of policy options.

00:18:54

Another useful tool would be the extensive communication from doctors and health experts on the health risks associated with alcohol consumption. Apart from the health issues.
We may include the physical verbal violence, the irresponsible driving, the anti-social behaviour, some accidents, etc.
So basically we could target different kinds of groups like schools, universities, work and family also.
The social media, television, podcast, radio and newspapers for this kind of campaign.
And this is the bibliography which helped me to deliver the presentation, in particular the findings and some conclusions and recommendations on the alcohol drinking problem in general in the UK, but in general as well.

00:19:54

And here I would like to show you the appendix of the Rstudio commands and the screenshots I have copy pasted here on the PowerPoint presentation.

00:20:08

I don't know to what extent you will be able to see the commands in PPT.

00:20:14

So let me just.

00:20:18

Go through by clicking the button and for you to see my screenshots of the Rstudio commands.

00:20:26

Before that, I would like to thank you for your attention and it was really a very interesting and challenging task to perform this kind of exercise on Rstudio and to find out some interesting insights on alcohol consumption in England, based on the Health Survey for England.
So thank you very much for your attention.
I will go through the slides now.

## End of Module Assessment 2: Individual Reflection

**Assignment topic**

**This assessment focuses on your reflections on the skill and knowledge gained from the module. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through. Your reflection should address the following: Reflect in your data analysis skill and statistical knowledge and discuss how confident you are using R for statistical data analysis. Mention any challenges you faced.  Reflect upon your experience of interpreting statistical findings using p-value and confidence interval.  Also reflect upon on producing summary tables, contingency tables and producing plots using R.**

The Numerical Analysis module is part of the MSc programme, I am following at the University of Essex Online, in the field of Artificial Intelligence.   The aim of this module is for postgraduate students to: ‘a) develop a systematic understanding of foundational mathematical principles and methods, b) facilitate their ability to interpret the results generated when using data science and AI tools, c) critically evaluate the use of statistical analysis and the numeric interpretation of results as aids in the decision-making process and d) critically appraise and present results of a statistical analysis to a diverse audience’ (UoEO Module Home, n.d.).  A prominent role in achieving these objectives plays the familiarisation of the postgraduate student with the RStudio, which makes statistical data analysis and representation of analysis results (plots, graphs) of large datasets much easier and faster.

For this individual reflection, I will make use of mainly two reflective models: 
a) ‘What? So What? Now what?’ (experience, implication of the situation and action plan) (Driscol, 1994 and Rolfe et al., 2001) and 
b) the Gibbs’ reflective Cycle (description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, action plan) (UoEO Short Guide to Reflective Writing, n.d. and The University of Edinburgh Reflection Toolkit, n.d.).  

According to the structure of the module, mathematical concepts and foundations of statistical data analysis were first presented on the learning platform either via lecturecasts, unit notes, or reading lists.  Further, we were tasked to perform RStudio commands to get a certain given result (by following the recommended material instructions).  Then, we were supposed to perform several formative tasks and data activities, to familiarise ourselves with the software and learn how to formulate commands (coding process) and get data analysis results by ‘trial and error’.
Given that I do not come from a STEM background myself, having to deal with mathematical concepts and statistical foundations was quite overwhelming for me, not to say a daunting task.  However, I was aware that some basic concepts of statistical analysis would be very helpful for me to advance with the following modules in the Artificial Intelligence programme.  What I have learned in this module, I believe will largely help me interpret statistical analysis results (assessing the p-value, the Confidence Interval (CI), the correlation co-efficient etc), be critical about the robustness of the findings and evaluate the usefulness of the statistical results as aids to decision-making process.

I enjoyed the first introductory units of the module very much, where basic mathematical and statistical concepts were effectively explained such as mean/median, minimum/maximum/range, variance/standard deviation, the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics etc.  In this effort of mine, my principal ally was the unit notes, the recommended reading lists, the seminar sessions and the activities we were asked to perform later.  The pace of the learning was normal, at least in the first half of the module, but it acquired much greater difficulty towards the end.  

In the last units, it has to be borne in mind that the lecturecasts were very difficult to understand, as they were intended for a more expert audience or at least to those who were already knowledgeable.  This is why I got to watch them again and again and, in particular, after having read the recommended bibliography, watched YouTube videos and visited informative websites on statistics and RStudio (Annex).   I was quite determined to get a grasp of all items to be covered in the module, so I made use of every available reliable source apart from the module material (Annex).  I also exchanged a series of emails with my tutor who kindly gave me feedback on the commands I had performed on RStudio and some hints when I needed some extra help.  
Another formative activity that also contributed to my learning process was engaging in a discussion with my peers (Collaborative discussions 1 & 2). Even though, due to the non-mandatory nature of the activity, not all peers contributed to the discussion, I exchanged valuable opinions with those who participated.  Having to draft a post and respond to the comments of the peers, made me read other material than that offered in the module, from the University of Essex online library and the Google Scholar.  Writing a post in a collaborative discussion forum may be work-intensive, as each postgraduate student is keen to share an impactful contribution, which will generate interest (Annex).

Nevertheless, the trickiest part for my learning process was performing commands and getting statistical results on RStudio.  This seemed to me quite frustrating at some point, as the absence of a bracket ‘()’ or the superfluous addition of a character made the software giving an ‘error’.  In many cases, it was not clear to me where the error was lying.  This is why I had to repeat many times the commands, making sure that all components were included, ask guidance from my tutor, and seek help from reliable YouTube videos and websites.  After having completed the module, I now feel much more confident with at least the basic commands of the software such as performing basic arithmetic, converting variables, and managing missing variables, developing graphs and plots, creating sub samples, performing statistical analysis using a null or alternative hypothesis, taking a decision based on p-value and statistical significance and running normality tests, correlations tests, and regression analysis.

Familiarising myself with RStudio and statistical analysis made me realise how important it is to be able to understand if the result I get is statistically significant, if I can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative one (when the p-value is lower than 0.05), how to interpret the Confidence Interval etc  This will help me get an insight into whether the statistical analysis I read is reliable or not, so I can make an evidence-informed decision.  I am sure that the valuable knowledge gained in this module will help me understand better how the Artificial Intelligence is working as well as its potential and opportunities but also its risks and implications in our lives.

To conclude, I got to understand how important it is to learn by experience and by ‘trial and error’, especially when having to learn mathematical and statistical analysis concepts and perform RStudio commands.  While the feeling of frustration when you do not get the desired result or when you find it difficult to grasp a certain concept is overwhelming, on the other hand, it is equally rewarding when you are patient, read very carefully the material, ask the tutor for guidance, follow the seminar sessions, watch YouTube videos, seek other reliable sources and finally when you deepen your knowledge and reach the desired objective.
